A big step project done by us 3rd year CS students of CVSU-IMUS CAMPUS PHILIPPINES.
It uses python to function.
To run the project, run cmd as admin> cd (project directory)> venv\scripts\activate.
Run the admin.py to start adding/deleting faculty members from the registered database.
Face capture takes 30 images and voice capture takes 5 recordings with 3s each.
Then run main.py to start verifiying faculty members via face or voice verification.
Verification has a liveness test which is blink test for face verification.
Blink test aims to counter any picture/photo/image attempts rather than an actual human being trying to verify.
Phrase test aims to counter any pre-recored messages attempts rather than an actual human being trying to verify.
Note: data that might be left in the database is the developers themselves thats testing the project itself.
